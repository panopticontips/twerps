Was behind https://www.facebook.com/unitedright/, which is now gone.  It was a facebook page where he used to sell merch, such as a shirt that said "Reich Wing Extremist."

 Derrick Davis moved to Richmond to attend VCU in 2013.  When he first arrived in Richmond, he was involved in the libertarian/ anarcho-capitalist community.  He was also active in the goth community online, hosting the show "Alt Talk Live" under his old youtube username "Dark Night Rises."  These were archives at https://alttalknetwork.com/., which is now down.

He used to consider himself the "Grand High Patriach" of the "Viamist" religion.  This religion, which he made up, had a hilarious website using stock images of futurist looking civilizations, where Derrick would also post racist poetry.  Unfortunately he has since converted to neo-Paganism.
