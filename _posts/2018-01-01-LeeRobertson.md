 Those who want to live, let them fight, and those who do not want to fight in this world of eternal struggle do not deserve to live. 88  Do not compare yourself to others. If you do so, you are insulting yourself. 88  He alone, who owns the youth gains the future. 88   Humanitarianism is the expression of stupidity and cowardice. 88   Anyone can deal with victory. Only the mighty can bear defeat. 88   Life doesnt forgive weakness. 88  We are twice armed if we fight with faith.  Plato   Good people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly, while bad people will find a way around the law.  Plato   One of the penalties for refusing to participate i politics is that you end up being governed by inferiors.  Plato   The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself; to be conquered by yourself is of all things most shameful and vile.  Plato  He who is not a good servant will not be a good master.  Plato  For a man to conquer himself is the first and noblest of all victories.  Plato   Only the dead have seen the end of the war.  Plato   Love is composed of single soul inhabiting two bodies - Aristotle  A friend to all is a friend to none. - Aristotle   Good habits formed at youth make all the difference. - Aristotle   He who is to be a good ruler must have first been ruled. - Aristotle   The most perfect political community is one in which the middle class is in control, and outnumbers both of the other classes. - Aristotle   The educated differ from the uneducated as much as the living from the dead. - Aristotle

Dont part with your illusions. When they are gone you may still exist, but you have ceased to live.The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at anytime.Go to heaven for the climate, hell for the company
