Facebook Details section: ***WARNING WARNING WARNING***  This facebook page may contain EXPLICIT  SOVEREIGN GRACE LANGUAGE, CHRISTOCENTRIC THEMES, and STRONG REFERENCES TO SOVEREIGNTY   Voicing God's truth is my forte. If you don't like talking about God, you probably won't like me. Just saying.  Keeping it real. Don't be fake.  I don't believe in exalting myself on facebook because exaltation belongs to the Lord. Nobody cares what you look like or how tough or popular you try to pose in your pictures anyway. My fb page is dedicated to:  1) bringing awareness to the Biblical doctrines of grace known as T.U.L.I.P.   Total Depravity  Unconditional Election  Limited Atonement  Irresistible Grace  Perseverance of the Saints  TULIP exalts God and summarizes how God saves sinners (the gospel).  2) creating a platform for edifying discussion and debate. Thus causing brain muscles to exercise and hearts to be moved if God so chooses.  3) utterly exposing perverted doctrine and perverts of the Word.     A sinner who has been utterly captivated by the grace of God.  May i never look to my works again but to Christ Jesus alone to His cross i cling.  (This is what i bleieve. I believe I am so spiritually corrupt and prideful and rebellious that I would never have come to faith in Jesus without God’s merciful, sovereign victory over the last vestiges of my rebellion. (1 Corinthians 2:14; Ephesians 3:1–4; Romans 8:7).  I believe that God chose me to be his child before the foundation of the world, on the basis of nothing in me, foreknown or otherwise. (Ephesians 1:4–6; Acts 13:48; Romans 8:29–30; 11:5–7)  I believe Christ died as a substitute for sinners to provide a bona fide offer of salvation to all people, and that he had an invincible design in his death to obtain his chosen bride, namely, the assembly of all believers, whose names were eternally written in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain. (John 3:16; John 10:15; Ephesians 5:25; Revelation 13:8)  When I was dead in my trespasses, and blind to the beauty of Christ, God made me alive, opened the eyes of my heart, granted me to believe, and united me to Jesus, with all the benefits of forgiveness and justification and eternal life. (Ephesians 2:4–5; 2 Corinthians 4:6; Philippians 2:29; Ephesians 2:8–9; Acts 16:14; Ephesians 1:7; Philippians 3:9)  I am eternally secure not mainly because of anything I did in the past, but decisively because God is faithful to complete the work he began—to sustain my faith, and to keep me from apostasy, and to hold me back from sin that leads to death. (1 Corinthians 1:8–9; 1 Thessalonians 5:23–24; Philippians 1:6; 1 Peter 1:5; Jude 1:25; John 10:28–29; 1 John 5:16)  Call it what you will, this is my life. I believe it because I see it in the Bible. And because I have experienced it. Everlasting praise to the greatness of the glory of the grace of God!)  I dedicated to the glory of God, the pre-eminence of Christ, the salvation of sinners, and the edification of God’s people by preaching and teaching the Gospel doctrines of sovereign grace as defined in God’s Word. my purpose is to promote the Gospel of God’s free and sovereign grace in the Lord Jesus Christ.    IT IS GOD WHO: - draws people to Himself (John 6:44,65).  - creates a clean heart (Psalm 51:10). - appoints people to believe (Acts 13:48).  - works faith in the believer (John 6:28-29).  - chooses who is to be holy and blameless (Eph. 1:4).  - chooses us for salvation (2 Thess. 2:13-14).  - grants the act of believing (Phil. 1:29).  - grants repentance (2 Tim. 2:24-26).  - calls according to His purpose (2 Tim. 1:9).  - causes us to be born again (1 Pet. 1:3).  - predestines us to salvation (Rom. 8:29-30).  - predestines us to adoption (Eph. 1:5).  - predestines us according to His purpose (Eph. 1:11).  - makes us born again not by our will but by His will (John 1:12-13).  IT IS MAN WHO: - is deceitful and desperately sick (Jer. 17:9).  - is full of evil (Mark 7:21-23).  - loves darkness rather than light (John 3:19).  - is unrighteous, does not understand, does not seek for God (Rom. 3:10-12).  - is helpless and ungodly (Rom. 5:6).  - is dead in his trespasses and sins (Eph. 2:1).  - is by nature a child of wrath (Eph. 2:3).  - cannot understand spiritual things (1 Cor. 2:14).  - is a slave of sin (Rom. 6:16-20).   Jesus didn't die on the cross merely to make it 'possible' for you to become saved. Jesus actually accomplished something ("It is finished") -- He purchased the church (the sheep) with His blood once for all. If salvation is based upon your "free will" choice, then you're saying that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross doesn't become effectual until YOU 'do' something. It's pitiful what people do in order to protect their ear-tickling, seeker-friendly theology.   Arminianism (synergism) The doctrine where salvation is seen as a cooperative effort between God and man and man has something to boast in. Calvinism (monergism) the doctrine that sees salvation as the work of God alone, from first to last with out the cooperative effort o man. Man has no boasting.  Arminianism is about freewill that it has something to do with salvation. Calvinism is about freewill that is has nothing to do with salvation. Arminianism is a prideful, boasting, false Gospel and a counterfeit Christ . Calvinism is a God honoring true gospel and has the true Christ. Arminians say God saved me and I helped. Calvinists say salvation is of the Lord   When it comes to Arminianism, I have what is called a ZERO TOLERANCE. This means that it is something I completely and strictly abhor (regard with disgust and hatred) with all my power. We all need to speak against it and expose it for what it is, a counterfeit invention tactic from the devil's backyard.  Here is my prayer for you all. May Abba Yahweh Bless you and Keep you ... may He shine the Light of His Countenance upon you and be gracious to you ... may He turn His Face toward you and give you His Shalom -- in Yahshua's Name, Ahmein.
