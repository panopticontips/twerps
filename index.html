The Traditionalist Workers Party (TWP) was a white nationalist group who sought to create a white ethnostate in america. They were founded in 2015 by Matthew Heimbach, who rose to racist fame by creating a “white student union” at Towson University in 2012. He eventually brought his bigoted conspiracy theories and racial domination ideologies to the national stage by forming the Traditionalist  Youth Network (the direct predecessor to TWP and eventually the “youth wing” of the party) in 2013 along with his brother in bigotry Matthew Parrott. This meeting of the minds mashed together classic neo-Confederate ideology a la League of the South with traditional Nazism, often citing Strasser and Hitler, and neo-Nazism with Heimbach’s ties to Greece’s Golden Dawn Party.  In 2016 they took an integral role in creating the Nationalist Front, an alliance between various hate groups across the country.

Over the years, the TWP took part in multiple public demonstrations always armed with weapons looking for a fight, including Sacramento in 2016 (with the help of the Golden State Skinheads donning the absurdly LARPy TWP shields and uniforms) in Charlottesville, Pikesville, & Shelbyville in 2017, as well as providing “security” in cringey costumes in front of famed neo-Nazi coward Richard Spencer’s speaking events. They were always met with antifa resistance. They were often beat down and they were always embarrassed.

Then the box broke.
<br>
The box was holding up Matt Parrott and his step-daughter/Heimbach’s wife as they were spying on Parrot’s wife and Matthew Heimbach fucking. Traditionalism.
<br>
The two Matthews fought.
<br>
The cops were called.
<br>
Heimbach chocked his wife in front of their children.
<br>
Heimbach got arrested and the TWP’s reign of violent racial terror and goofy imagery was over.

<br>
<br>

Amid the sudden destruction of the party by the actions of their very own leader, infighting spilled out onto social media. On Facebook, Derrick Davis posted a video of himself burning the TWP flag, Colton Williams, in an arrogant child-like fit of anger, declared in a post that he would form his own new group (a declaration he seems to have backed-out on), and George White made a few posts begging former members to stay with the group as it rebrands and becomes the Nationalist Initiative. Further injuring the group was the <a href="https://www.unicornriot.ninja/2018/leaked-a-year-inside-the-failed-neo-nazi-traditionalist-worker-party/">leak of internal Discord chat logs by Unicorn Riot</a>.

<br>

Even though the TWP is in ruins and the rebranded group Nationalist Initiative hasn't gotten its footing yet, what's clear is that the former members of the TWP continue to be dangerous Nazis that must be countered and made unable to act on their beliefs. The former members will of course desire to organize, either with NI or with other groups. It is for this reason that we release a mass doxx of former TWP members/close-associates so that we know who these people are and we can protect our communities from them.

<br>
<br>

The research presented here is only preliminary -- it is intended to be a mass outing -- with the hope that others will continue to dig deeper.

<br>
<br>

Here's a summary of the data: 
<br>
- We found 67 Facebook accounts belonging to TWP members / affiliates
<br>
- These 67 accounts belong to 47 different people (a few of whom are already well known).
<br>
- We provide evidence of TWP affiliation for each person.
<br>
- We have good photos of 42 of these people
<br>
- We have a believable location for 39 of them
<br>
- They are spread across 16 states: Kentucky (8), Indiana (5), Ohio (5), Georgia (3), Tennessee (3), Texas (3), Arkansas (2), New York (2), Virginia (2), Alabama (1), Maryland (1), Maine (1), Michigan (1), North Carolina (1), Pennsylvania (1), Wisconsin (1)
<br>
- We connected 10 people with their Discord handles in the chat logs released by Unicorn Riot.
